Please enjoy this seasonally appropriate javascript.
It spawns snow, but can also be used for leaves, rain (give it a high fall speed), and falling skulls, or raining flames!
Images are included in the seasonal_js_img folder, where you can replace them with your own snow graphics.

You can adjust wind velocity, and snow amount, and the falling speed!

You can also make it stop snowing with the clear weather stop_snowing() function.

To start snowing call start_snowing(50, 10, 5); in your page's onload or on an elements click event, and adjust it with your desired values...
